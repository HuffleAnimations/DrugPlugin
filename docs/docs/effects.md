## Cocaine
When you are high on cocaine, you will get a speedboost that lasts 30 seconds.

If you take 5 pieces of cocaine in less than 10 minutes, you will overdose.

## Heroin
When you take heroin, you will start levitating in the air while being invisible 
for 16 seconds, with a notification saying: "It starts to feel like you're flying"

This lasts for 8 seconds, followed by you slowly descending to the ground for another 8 seconds.  
After that, you will be teleported to the place where you originally took the heroin, with a notification
saying: "But it was just a dream..."

If you take 3 pieces of heroin in less than 5 minutes, you will overdose.
